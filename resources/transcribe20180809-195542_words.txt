hi hi Hi how are you how about you a long day yeah show me feel a little bit tired I'm a bit drowsy very wet it's raining outside and it's hot I'm not used to this rainy season when will this be over about like when will the when will the season be over yeah I'm going back soon but I still have a couple more days left so that means I have to tolerate this humidity oh well okay yeah so so yeah we start so did you receive my little wizard so we are talking like thank you for sending that like documents and we have few questions I would like to ask you so firstly who are you to get it out like I mean for this login this document I think was a call for participation for the preliminaries right yes so we just read that document and there were like all the information seems to be not for the participants but for the organizers I thought that was what you wanted I am not wrong yeah but the thing is I kinda copied last year's I think you can come this is for the organizers if I remember correctly should have made it for the participants or was that a different story I think we need both is okay yeah yeah this is for the organizer but we also need the documents for the participants to Tilden how the event is like okay so yeah I would like to ask you this again okay I did not think that that would be my stuff but okay fine okay when is that do maybe next week same as this document last year's material is shared so you can copy it so I'll see it's on get love right yes okay so I'll check that as well and I'll my email updated once again and then I will email you by once again next Thursday yes if you could okay yeah please do okay so and also we have some questions regarding this material okay I would like you to ask you that to that can make them document a little bit shorter shoulder okay because it is like too many contents okay I can take too much time to read it is for the organizer organizer should be the executive so they have few time to read okay so if it would be great if you could make it like one page condense everything in general yes yeah and make it like half the size or something yes that would be perfect so it can I get can I ask you to do that I think there's not much of a big deal I just have to restock the detailed information that I have for everything so just make it into like only the topics so that I think I can do not it's not a big deal so and also like I have a question as far as the East is about the global final which is on the first page and this says that Global final will be held in Los Angeles and Germany yes what is that correct that is a good question who is hosting the event because you know we don't have an office in Los Angeles Zoo e y y Alejandra what did I want to write and I really want to ride the correct so do you mean that are you are not going to have a final in Switzerland we are going to if I remember correctly so but I think Colin or was it so we were wondering which where to book or hotels as well what was what do you do you prefer like do you want Switzerland Switzerland like our city thinking like this you like Switzerland team is hosting the event you should be easier to like hold even dance with the kind of confused because it seems like to me I lost continent of the place we are the host country and it also we wanted to check so what TIG Tokyo mean let's see what I wrote what did I write I am so sorry i g Tokyo technology should be in Japan is that the correct did I write your department wrong where department is sorry I forgot the English day yeah maybe had the wrong initials for your department so I thought that was TIG was it not then it's thought it was right but I don't know maybe I was wrong so and also I do want I don't have the paper documents right Do you want us to send us yeah but it is about the timeline it I know I made it safe 2017 so please renew Tennessee that after I sent it and also so I'll and the first thing it says organisation kit delivery is May 31st so it has already been delivered to our organizers yes okay so maybe we need to check in please maybe it was maybe it's postponed somewhere I'm not sure so and the next thing is so about the original preliminary it says it starts from June 1st and by August 31st years and we were we just wanted to make sure that I'll when will be Japan's preliminary preliminary I thought will be in September yes so that's what we are thinking because what are the dates we are not really sure yet so but but sometimes in September okay like in mid September late September or early September maybe September okay check the date and tell me yes yes so so since this document says it's from June 1st and over August 31st so all the preliminaries except Japan will be held in that term okay so you have the finale so maybe we can check Yes that's correct that's okay and next is for financial support and we were talking like all this paper says that about the final will cover the like financials and resources for the final but does not that cover travel expenses to participants we were talking maybe if we could cover some parts for the black weather next flight ticket or hotel can be like I will make it easier for participants to join Then how about we pay them like let's say like 800 Euro for like for everyone who are the flight ticket like whatever flight they choose they get a hundred-year-old meet maybe they need to add a little bit but I think everyone's equally okay so yeah so please change this part like that so I about the evaluation criteria and this stays that so patient ratio is innovation 20% engineering 70% and business impact 10% and fine with that but it's looks so I want to hear your opinion do you want to flatten out like 30 30 40 or 20 53 okay back like a wave with more emphasis on engineering more than presentation that is very true 5033 50 20 30 50 20 more or the business more what are your opinions on 5020 50 20 thank you I should be cuz you leave talked before about the engineering should be valued more but yeah 70 was probably too much yeah let's make it 315 20 and so that they mama is yes I agree with that and it also says there is a secret team which will be revealed in the final and if sounds exciting original organizers can I change the event at their own unique conditions so maybe something very unique to each region I just curious to know how sweet Salon team will be doing the preliminary right now is more about sustainability I mean like our country in general so we want to use the theme of sustainability with together with all to mr I don't know about Japan but like maybe you have the Olympics coming up so maybe you can bond with that that's a good idea maybe we can discuss with organizers okay thank you very much k our last question is that about the platform and Technology it says like it cost a little bit to use environment how much does it cost it says like a pay-per-use basis because it was our first time to see this condition so miss the team that you have in your maybe we should check ask him how much it should cost Delta Vista Service pay some kind of fee for that's what I read I remember if I remember I will check maybe my memory is your team I mean like you're all to miss the team okay so that's all for us and we thought that all since these documents is a little bit too long maybe basically you can all make it half and one is for organized I want is for participants great so let's talk about this in next week's meeting and the next thing is your item oh yes oh it's the logo you've received my logo design so we are we prefer the first one the triangle shaped one because it looks matches with a technology or engineering like done a little study with my team as well and yeah they seem to like this one too so I guess we both agree on direction we should go it's a little difficult to read into things too far is the 4th okay so do you like so do you have any particular fault that you want us to use in particular or can my design team decide again something easy to read this one is not nice simple and easy to read okay so I'll have them work on based on the phone please do that very small change the last thing I miss is the jury selection yes did you have them selling did they say anything I think they're fine with doing the series okay so now we have two juries which is good how about the remaining for hissong matsubara we are working with you guys to research together okay okay I was already hot and you do research together and so you guys know each other and yes we know what relation is bitter that's good maybe we just can see if he can you send me some information that you have internet or Facebook or whatever yes I will send you the link it's good that you already have a relationship and so you know them and they know you okay that's good the I mean in literature okay once again once again mini projects just know you're busy guy kids and vest oh that's wonderful fantastic wonderful us like if you are like fine with it yeah yeah I think they're completely wonderful all three of the candidates are great I just want to know if they are open on the days of the finals and also like I I think we should check to your boss if it is okay to expect juries like almost all the dirtiest movie Japanese but let me check with Oliver and he can give me some advice if there is some things that we should change or not But I think having people outside our company is good I like being so I think they are a very good candidate should have people outside our company think about what we're doing as well so yeah then we will check also please ask your boss yes I will they want to take some people from your company or in your country so I will do that let me get back to you next week during that time you can check their schedules if they're open Okay okay so that's it for today yes do you have any questions can you please run me through on
