Hi Hi How are you I'm fine You're fine Good Good How about you Not bad It's been a long day Yeah We feel a little bit tired I'm a bit drowsy I mean it's not this humid usually in Europe you know Very humid very wet it's raining outside and it's hot I'm not used to this Summer in Tokyo Yeah Summer in Tokyo It's rainy season When will this season be over 梅雨っていつ終わるの。 In two weeks Three weeks Three weeks Okay I should wait three weeks Okay fine You will be going back soon right Yeah I'm going back soon but I still have couple more days left That means I have to tolerate this humidity So shall we start Did you receive the material that I sent to you Yeah we did We are talking like thank you for sending the documents We have questions I would like to ask you So firstly who are you targeted at I mean for this document Umm this document I think was a call for participation for the preliminaries right Yes We just read the document you sent but the information seemed to be not for the participants but for the organizers I thought it was what you wanted if I'm not wrong The thing is I kind of copied last year's document I think you can kinda tell Okay so this is for the organizer This is for the organizer if I remember correctly Should I have made it for participants Or was that a different story Ah yeah I think we need both Ah we need both Okay This is for the organizer but we also need the documents for the participants to tell them how the event is like So I would like to ask you to … Ah once again Okay I did not think that would be my stuff but okay fine When is that due Maybe next week Same as this document last year's material is shared so you can copy it Okay It's on GitLab right I'll check that as well and I'll Email me I will update it once again then I will email you byonce again next Thursday Yes if you could Okay Yeah please do Yeah Also we have questions regarding this material But firstly I would like to ask you to make the document a little bit shorter shorter Because it is too many contents and it takes too much time to read it through Ah was it long for you Too long Especially this document is for organizers Basically the organizers should be the executive so they have few time to read So it would be great if you could make it like one page Okay I'll condense everything in general Yes Make it like half the size or something Yes that would be perfect So can I ask you to do that Yeah that I think it's not much of a big deal I just have to probably erase the detailed information that I have for everything Just make it to only the topics That I think I can do it's not a big deal Also I have a question The first is about the Global Final which is on the first page This says that the Global Final will be held in Los Angels and Germany but is that correct That's a good question Because it's Switzerland who is hosting the event That's interesting because we don't have an office in Los Angels do we Oh yeah Then why Los Angels I wanted to writewhat did I want to write Let me double check with the correct city So do you mean that you're not going to have a final in Switzerland Ummmwe are going to if I remember correctly Sobutumm … We are wondering where to book a hotel as well What do youdo you want Switzerland Switzerland is our city … Yes we are just thinking like since you Switzerland team is hosting the event it should be easier to hold the event in Switzerland but we were kind of confused because it says like Los Angels … Yeah Los Angels is completely wrong Sorry It's a different continent Yeah so but you will check the place but one of the place should be Switzerland Yes yes Okay Since we are the host country Okay so please double check and tell us And also we wanted to check what TIG Tokyo means Let's see what I wrote What did I write Sorry Yes here you are TIG Technologywe were talking like it should be one of the team in NTT Data Japan Is that correct Did I write your department name wrong Ahour department issorry I forgot the English name Yeah because I thought maybe I had the wrong initials for your department Technology Integrated Group 技統本？ Technology Integrated Group so I thought that was TIG Was i not Ah then it's us It should be us Okay okay Technology Integrated Group so this is 技術統括本部 in Tokyo Is it right I thought it was right I don't know maybe I was wrong Yeah it is totally fine Because we are not used to calling our name in English Ah yes yes If you don't have the paper document right now do you want us to send the document You don't have the data … Actually I do I do but it's fine So the next thing is about the timeline Timeline I know I made a mistake right Yes it says 2017 so please renewchange it to 2018 Yeah I realized after I sent this Also the first thing it says organization kit delivery is May 31st so it has already been delivered to our organizers right Yes Okay so maybe we need to check Yes please Maybe it wasmaybe it *** somewhere Okay we will check our organizers Next thing is about the regional preliminary It starts from June 1st and by August 31st And we just wanted to make sure that when will be Japan's preliminary Japan's preliminary I thought it will be in September Yes that's what we are thinking because … What are the dates Ah we are not really sure yet Sobut some time in September Okay Like in mid September Late September Early September Maybe early September Early Early September Okay Please check the date and tell me So since this document says it's from June 1st and August 31st all the preliminaries except Japan will be held in that term Japan is the final You are the general headquarter so I thought it would be … Okay so maybe we can check that to organizers too And Global Final is November 8th and 9th that's correct That's okay And next is for financial support We are talking like this paper says that about the final TIG Tokyo will cover the financials and the resources for the final but does not cover the expenses to participants but we were talking maybe if we could cover some part for example whether flight tickets or hotel can bewill make it easier for participants to join the event Okay then how about we pay them like 800 euro for everyone Like whatever flight they choose they get 800 euro Ah okay That should be nice 800 euro should make it Maybe they need to add a little bit But I think it is good So everyone's equal If they want to get business class they can But they only get 800 euro Okay then please change this part like that And next thing isabout the evaluation criteria This says that evaluation ratio is innovation 20% engineering 70% and business impact 10% We are fine with that but it looks a little bit extreme so I want to hear your opinion Ah do you want to flatten out like 30 30 40 or … Umm 20 50 30 20 50 30 okay 70 is probably too much Yes Becausethe paper says that we got a feedback like we put more emphasis on engineering more than presentation and we agree with that But business impact 10% is a little bit too low That is very true Okay let's do 20 50 30 Or 30 50 20 30 50 20 So either value innovation more or business more What are your opinion Innovation 30 50 20 Let's make it that way That should be perfect Because we talked before that the engineering should be valued more But yeah 70 was probably too much Okay let's make it 30 50 20 Okay Then the next is about the challenge Theme is Altemista which we agree with that And also there is a Secret theme which will be revealed in the final and it sounds exciting But the last part the document says that each regional preliminary organizers can change the event at their own unique conditions so the preliminary will be something very unique to each region so I was just curious to know how Switzerland team will be doing the preliminary Yeah our focus right now is more about sustainability I mean like our country in general So we want to use the theme of sustainability together with the Altemista I don't know about Japan but maybe you have the Olympics coming up so maybe you can bond with that That's a good idea Maybe we can discuss with organizers Okay thank you very much And our last question is that about the platform and technology It says like it costs a little bit to use Altemista environment How much does it cost It says pay per use basis I know but what are the plans you have I'm not sure about that because it was our first time to see this condition Ah how about the Altemista team that you have in your … Ah maybe we should check ask Altemista team how much it should cost ん？ The Altemista service … なんかお金かかるって。アルテミス他チームに聞いたらわかりますかね。 Don't you have people pay some kind of fee for That's what I read I remember Altemista team … Maybe they know We will check We will ask Yeah because maybe my memory is not correct I thought you have the plan Your team I mean like your Altemista team Okay that's all for us And we thought that since this document is a little bit too long maybe you can make it half and one is for organizers and one is for participants Ah okay let's do that That should be easier for you to make I can do that okay great Okay let's talk about this in the next meeting too Okay Thank you very much I got good feedback And the next thing is your item It's the logo You received the logo that my design team designed Yes yes So umm we prefer the first one the triangle shaped one because it looksmatches with the technology or engineering image What is your idea Well yeah I've actually done a little study with my team as well yeah they seem to like this one too So I guess we both agree on the direction we should go One thing I thought is it's a little bit difficult to read NTT Data Global Hackathon Yeah I'll change the font Font font Please change the font yes Do you have any particular font that you want us to use in particular Or my design team can decide again Something easy to read is fine This one is not easy to read How about the one in the third one's fond This one I think this is nice Nice nice Simple and easy to read Okay I'll have them work on based on the font Okay please do that It's a very small change so you can … Yes it's not that hard for me to change that That's perfect for logo design Okay Then last thing is the jury selection Yes Did you have them signed Sign sign Two members' sign Ah thank you very much Did they say anything なんだろう、なんだろうな。 They are fine with doing the juries No problem No problem Okay great That's an important thing to know Okay now we have two juries which is good How about the remaining juries Professor Matsubara University of Hakodate … Future University Future University We なんだろう、なんていえばいいんだ… We are working with なんていえばいいのかなあ。 Do you guys research together Research together Research together as a project Okay so you do research together you guys know each other and good relation He's better AI specialist Okay that's good Maybe we just can see Helen who is he Can you send me some information that you have Or you can search him on internet facebook or whatever I will send you a link Okay But it's good you already have a relationship and you know them and they know you Okay that's good And Mr Hagiwara Mr Hagiwara is professor of Keio University And we researched with he Once again You research together Another project You've got a lot of project going on Many projects うん。 Just now just now Just now You're a busy guy And Mr Higuchi Higuchi is NTT Data member He's a best AI specialist in NTT Data Okay that's wonderful Fantastic Now we have three candidates Wonderful Maybe we will ask if you are fine with it Yeah I think they're completely wonderful All three of the candidates are great I just want to know if they are open on the days of final Also I think we should check to your boss if it is okay to select juries almost all the juries will be Japanese so … Let me check with Oliver and he can give me some advice if there is something we can change or not But I think having people outside company is good Like university So Mr Matsubara and Mr Hagiwara will be a good … I think they are very good candidates We should have people outside the company think about what we are doing as well Then we will check Mr Matsubara and Mr Hagiwara and Mr Higuchi if they want to do the jury of the event but also please ask your boss if they want to select some people from your company or the professors in your country Okay I will do that and get back to you next week Yes yes And during that time you can check their schedules if they are okay Yes we will check Okay That's it for today Yeah Do you have any questions Umm can you please run me through on what we have decided today Today What we have talked today Ummm more things Many things Many things First is
