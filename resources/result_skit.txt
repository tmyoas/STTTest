i i are how a a hard you got yeah good how about you one i was in a long day care actually feel little bit tired i love the drowsy there is not a human to use our own in this line europe you know very human and very i when it's it's raining ah and high-five not uh and i used to this this is someone in tokyo yeah so'oialo is rainy season here or and follow like when will a when will this is in the over or or if so you correct uh we re in weeks really things really have if i should wait three weeks yeah you know fine but you always going back some day npr i still have a couple more days laughing and so that means i have to tolerate this oh yeah humidity you well okay yeah so so yeah so we started so in the first yeah i i received mine oh yeah i always elephant us i am um so we are talking y all thank you for listening a like documents look and ah ah we have a question from home i would like to ask you so firstly are who are you targeted apps like i mean for this documents ah yessss documentary thing was ah i hope for participation uh forth ah preliminaries right yes so i just read that well and yet i guess and what they were like other information learning to be not for the participants thought for the organized person was what you want it ah if i am not wrong yeah good thing is i kind of copy while years documentary yeah so yeah ah i think i think i like hello but um okay so this is for their organizer that's pretty organises outnumber correctly in organizer should i have made a fourth ah participants or well in a different story all year i think we need both ah boz okay yeah ah yes for the organizer but we also need the documents for the participants um to tell them how the even it's like um okay so yeah i have a like to ask you always again okay or he i did not think that that would be my stuff but okay fine okay when is that do maybe next week on save as this document okay that last year's materialism share so you can competition stolen okay so all see it on get real right yes okay so all check that as well and all um i i now yeah a updated once again and then i will email you buy me once again next thursday yes um if you could take oh yeah please do yeah okay so and also we have some questions little uh regarding this material okay but first day on i like to ask you that too like make them government other bit shorter shelter okay because of it is that too many like content okay and takes too much time to read it for ah that long and when you overall necessary so this if this document even more the organizers in basically all the organizing there should be exactly oh so they have few time to read ah okay so if it it would be great if you could make it's like one page okay so all condense everything in general yes um yeah oh and make it like half the size or something yes of them never be perfect a day so can it has to do that yeah i think there's not much of a big deal i just have to probably race the the detailed information that i have for everything so just make it into like only topics so that i think i can do not not a big deal yeah yeah so and also like um i have a question who at first is about the global final which is on the first pages and this face that global final will be held in los angeles and germany yes that is that collect but it's a good question it's restaurant to it yeah i think the even this interesting because i know we don't have an office in los angeles oh yeah cnn why why all of the nsa ah uh what i want to rise um uh everyone tries ah it looks economic the would do after the correct city in but ah ah so do you mean that are you're not going to have a final in switzerland ah ah we are going to if i remember correctly her so but in ah i think colin or was it though so we were wondering which where to book or hotels as well so ah ah um oh what was like i knew do you prefer life he wants isn't filling like our city s falling you know we are just thinking like um yes you like switzerland him is nothing that you venter it should be it here here like older even in switzerland yes but we were kind of confused because i felt like yeah i don't really overall completely wrong syesha ah a different continent you that you will check yeah the place class yes but one of the place just physical and yes yes yes again so please we are the host country where okay yes so with the water yes and at a loss okay and um and also we want a check so why are they are you talking all means ah see what i wrote what i am so sorry he along tokyo ah you the a like we were talking lines this should be one of the team in canada japan who is that correct yeah right you are um department wrong ah our department in health sorry i forgot the english cnn yeah i thought oh i yeah maybe i ve had the wrong initials for your department yeah oh i m a great degree looking people cannot integrating thought that was the idea was not and then it's a financial loss okay okay technology integrated so this is uh it's talk home or take it right but i thought it was right but i only has one thing it's only find again because we were not used to you going art in his ah yes yes yes you and also how do you want i i don't have the paper the inside i do want us to send us that documented have the data actually i do i do i do but ah ah um yeah but yeah i signed cranium so the next a about the timeline but it i i know i mean yeah right on this is if a strange seventeen i you is we knew sense president and i realize that after i sent jcb and also so ah and the first thing is face organisations kids very various made very first so it has already being delivered to are are running this right yes yes okay so we many minutes tech obviously maybe it was maybe it's postpone somewhere inogashira so again we will check organisers and the next thing is so about the original preliminary oh it's a it starts from june first and by august thirty first yes and we were we just want to make sure that we will be japan's preliminary jnr thought will be in september yes so tough what we are thinking yet because if uh day ah we're not really sure yet so what of but sometimes in september okay like in mid-september main number early september maybe early early september noise and um okay so please check the date and tell me yes yes so so um face this say it documents a's it's from your first and all that was that i first so all the preliminaries except japan will be held in that term uh okay so than men is final you know you're that general headquarters so i thought it would be no care yeah ok you have the finale so maybe we can check up to me at home as a yes you know and cover finally yes november eighty nine that's correct that's okay and next is for financial support when we were talking like on this is a process that about the final uh there's a tokyo will like covered a like financial there resources for the final but does not cover travel expenses to participants but ah ah i we were talking maybe if we could cover some parts pro-life whether like livestock gets or hotel can be like like will make it easier for participants to join nhow about me pay even like let's say like a hundred euro for life but for everyone um all of light ticket like whatever like they choose ten getting hundred year all care that should be like i should make it yeah maybe i need a little bit annoyed well i think it's good so everyone equally even if they want to write business class they can uh i only get a hundred again so yeah that's so please tends this part like that okay and next and yes ah so ah okay one page favorite encouraged cereal and this they start so evolution ratio is like innovation twenty percent engineering seventy percent and business impact ten percent and we are finding that were it looks a little bit extreme so i want to hear your opinion i i want to flatten out like thirty thirty forty or uh i think the fifteen thirty oh i thirty okay in any probably too much like a on because i all yeah um you do ah on the paper says that ah definitely got the feedback like are we put more emphasis on engineering what about presentation yeah and we agree with that i was like business impact members and if a okay okay yeah that's rojin okay so let's who plan he fifty thirty yeah right yeah okay was at the the phone but if even artificial twenty so if you are either value innovation more or the business more um yes what are your opinions on which innovation one but i i can focus a lot of very definitely make it that way okay thank you after should be better you know because i am i i talked before about yeah the engineering should be valued more and or but yeah i was probably too much in so yeah that's make it but if the tokyo game ok then what next is about that challenge and so that they make it i think oh yes which we agree with that and it also says there is a secret team which will be revealed in the final and it's fun exciting you but ah ah and the last part's the documents say that uh it's original for an overnight others can change the events of their own unique conditions so maybe preventing a will be kind something very unique to each region nbc so i just wanted to i just curious to know how without wanting will be doing that preliminary yeah so our focus right now is more about sustainability then i mean like our country in general so we want to use the theme of sustaining routine always together without mister on um i don't know about japan but like maybe you have the olympics coming up so maybe you can go on with that's a good idea in maybe we can discuss with organizers um okay thank you very much okay and our last question is that so about the platform and technology it's safe like it costs a little bit to use on the side of ireland on what's the cost it's a like of papers whose basis ah yes yes i know but ah ah what the current plan you have i'm not sure about that because we it was our first time to see this conditions forfend thirteen that you have in your um maybe we should check after all different in how much it should cost uh oh look at a service activity there s not cold cold uhm how people young take some kind of thing for like read i remember i remember uh is so uh so one maybe they know what i will and yeah previouse like um yeah because maybe my memory is not gracefully i thought you have like a plan then working like you out messaging television okay so that's all for us ah and we thought that sense this documents yes a little too long maybe ah basically you can like oh making have and one is for organiser one is for participants ah okay they do that yeah okay easy way or you can make i can do that s okay great so let's talk about this connects with anything major no problem okay so i have very much i don good things okay thank you yes and the next thing is your i can ah yes so it's bologna everything use my local yeah that my in nineteen design jsa so on we are i prefer a first one okay now triangle one okay because it's are looks much less with a technology or engineering or like image take what is your idea pnnto little study with my mom team as well and yeah they seem to like this one room so i guess we both agree on either direction look at least at home ah one thing i thought is it's a little bit difficult to read and it is a degree overall thought is that one definitely and can afford a yes okay okay and it um okay so i like so you have any particular point that you want us to use in particular or can my design team decide again ah or something it read oh yes uh yeah this one is not even three-hour you know on the third one's point of this one cnn and i think it's nice like a simple and they easy-to-read okay so ah ah work on based on the fact that the third one please do that of so it's a very small changes are um yes i can like yes now is not that hard it might seem to make okay so perfect straightforward design and i guess then last they yes is enjoying section ah yes you have them sign five thousand members site ah you very much they say anything gchq so uh uh no i and then there's fine with i'm doing this series some of the overall problem great especially important things in lawyer okay so yeah and so now we have to you re's which is good yes how about the the remaining thirties one and so uh from is so much better okay smaller and do uh investing in gold you uh or connected to a that day uh i okay let me uh unintel uh like say uh oh uh no one jcb devices research together uh then it's signal has a as opposed okay you know really high you movies together and so you guys knowing each other and as we know that relation uh uh isn no matter with a uh i i especially for oh that's good uh uh uh uh maybe we just can see helen who is he ah you send me some information that you have ah yes and or i concerns for him on the internet you or facebook or
